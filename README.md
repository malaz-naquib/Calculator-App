# Calculator App

I imagine this app needs no introduction! It's a simple calculator app that I built from the ground up! :)

## Description:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

For this calculator, I started in HTML by creating a background section for the calculator itself, then a section for the display, and lastly a section for all our buttons. After assigning classes to various elements, I went into CSS get the calculator background, display box, and buttons lined up using flex-box. After getting the styling to my liking, I went into JavaScript to add some logic and conditionals to our buttons and display.

## Lessons Learned:

While the HTML and CSS side of this app was a breeze, the JavaScript side was a challenge for sure! I'd say the biggest lesson I learned was that there is never only one way to accomplish a project. Whenever I hit a roadblock, I would run into several solutions, but it was up to me to put together the pieces and see the bigger picture on how those solutions would fit into my program. Gotta say, I'm super proud of this one!
